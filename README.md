# Histopathologic Cancer Detection using CNNs

This project aims at identifying metastatic tissue from a series of provided histopathologic scans of lymph node sections by applying the principles of computer vision and transfer learning. To that end, a neural network consisting of a backbone for feature extraction and a classification head is trained on the histopathologic scans. In this case, the backbone of the model is based on the pre-trained ResNet50 algorithm for a better performance. Finally, the predictive capabilities of our CNN in cancer detection are assessed.
